"Document summarization[edit] Like keyphrase extraction, document summarization hopes to identify the essence of a text. A promising line in document summarization is adaptive document/text summarization.[3] Maximum entropy-based summarization[edit] Even though automating abstractive summarization is the goal of summarization research, most practical systems are based on some form of extractive summarization. Another important distinction is that TextRank was used for single document summarization, while LexRank has been applied to multi-document summarization. The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as \"in summary\" or \"not in summary\"."

"This is the first song that the band released without the Farro brothers.[62] The band released a live album named The Final Riot! on November 25, 2008. Hayley Williams has gone on to comment about the female aspect of the band saying that Paramore is not \"this girl-fronted band\" and it makes \"music for people to enjoy music, not so people can talk about my sexuality.\"[24] She wanted to make sure that she and her band got the chance to show what they can do as a rock band writing their own songs.\"[13] Williams wrote on the band's web site that \"the break will give that band 'a chance to get away and work out our personal issues'\"."
"Wikipedia_SentenceExtraction.txt"
"In short \"sentence extraction\" works as a filter which allows only important sentences to pass. Sentence extraction is a technique used for automatic summarization of a text. The major downside of applying sentence-extraction techniques to the task of summarization is the loss of coherence in the resulting summary. Procedure[edit] Usually, a combination of heuristics is used to determine the most important sentences within the document. Nevertheless, sentence extraction summaries can give valuable clues to the main points of a document and are frequently sufficiently intelligible to human readers."
"Wikipedia_TextMining.txt"
"The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, Ronen Feldman modified a 2000 description of \"text mining\"[2] in 2004 to describe \"text analytics.\"[3] Academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative: The National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. As most information (common estimates say over 80%)[5] is currently stored as text, text mining is believed to have a high commercial potential value. One online text mining application in the biomedical literature is PubGene that combines biomedical text mining with network visualization as an Internet service.[13][14] Biomedical applications[edit] Main article: Biomedical text mining A range of text mining applications in the biomedical literature has been described.[12]"
