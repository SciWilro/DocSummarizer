Methods[edit] Methods of automatic summarization include extraction-based, abstraction-based, maximum entropy-based, and aided summarization. Applications[edit] There are different types of summaries depending what the summarization program focuses on to make the summary of the text, for example generic summaries or query relevant summaries (sometimes called query-based summaries). Document summarization[edit] Like keyphrase extraction, document summarization hopes to identify the essence of a text. The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as \"in summary\" or \"not in summary\"."

"Wikipedia_SentenceExtraction.txt"	"He also distinguished between bonus words and stigma words, i.e. words that probably occur together with important (e.g. the word form \"significant\") or unimportant information. His idea of using key-words, i.e. words which occur significantly frequently in the document, is still one of the core heuristics of today's summarizers. Edmundson stressed the importance of title-words for summarization and was the first to employ stop-lists in order to filter uninformative words of low semantic content (e.g. In short \"sentence extraction\" works as a filter which allows only important sentences to pass. Nevertheless, sentence extraction summaries can give valuable clues to the main points of a document and are frequently sufficiently intelligible to human readers."

"Wikipedia_TextMining.txt"	"Academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative: The National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM), is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world. The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, Ronen Feldman modified a 2000 description of \"text mining\"[2] in 2004 to describe \"text analytics.\"[3] Biomedical applications[edit] Main article: Biomedical text mining A range of text mining applications in the biomedical literature has been described.[12] One online text mining application in the biomedical literature is PubGene that combines biomedical text mining with network visualization as an Internet service.[13][14] Further, private initiatives also offer tools for academic text mining: Newsanalytics.net provides researchers with a free scalable solution for keyword-based text analysis."
